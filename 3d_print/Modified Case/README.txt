I made the PCB board 100mm x 100mm, since JLC are much cheaper
if you remain inside that size.


The board has 3 female header sockets, a long one for the 8 LED
signals, one at the back for the screen, and one on the right side
which isn't connected to anything. (The rotary is mounted on the
main board.)

LEDs, buttons and screen mount on the daughterboard which fits on
top of the main board.

There's a nice aluminium panel for the top surface, with drilled
LED holes and screen print. These are cheap on JLC, just remember
to turn off the testing. Round the corners, needs 4 screw holes
in the corners.

Any components needed on the daughterboard board can go on the
underside. That will allow the aluninimum panel to lay on top.



ADDITIONAL: I've done the aluminium plate, but I'm not sure how the
red LEDs will look against the silver. Might as well make a black
one as well so I can choose.


Height, assuming Picos in header sockets, would be about 20mm
from tip of pin on underside to top surface of Pico. The Spectrum
is just over 30mm, so I'll make the case flush with the top of
the Spectrum.


From TomD:

"My side walls are 2mm thick and I find this strong enough for most
use cases. The case does have a little flex but that is preferred to
something totally rigid. Also need to be careful on the part closest
to the Spectrum as too thick will mean the connector cannot go in far
enough. I made the top and bottom 1mm thick to give as much room as
possible. Overall the case isn't IF2 sturdy, which is probably 3mm
thickness, but easily good enough."

Good point about the edge connector fouling.
